This is an example project of MVVM + RxSwift. This was created during live coding demonstration of RxSwift and UITableView implementation.


Next Tasks:-
- Use Github public API insted of dummy data (`curl -i https://api.github.com/users/aksswami/repos`)
- Create a textfield which takes `username` as input and a button, which fetch all the repos corresponding to that `username`
- Follow MVVM style only and try to use Rx only.
